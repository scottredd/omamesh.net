# OmaMesh Update — Regional Links, Real Distances, and a Growing Mesh

It’s time for another OmaMesh update. January turned out to be a quietly important month on the air — not because of any single flashy feature, but because a lot of things are now working **consistently**, and more people are actively using the mesh.

Here’s a snapshot of where things stand.

---

## 📊 By the Numbers (January at a Glance)

- **7,000+ on-air observations** logged in January  
- **150+ distinct node identities** seen at least once  
- **Dozens of nodes active** on a typical day  
- **4–6 hop paths** now routine  
- **6–8 hop paths** observed during testing  
- **70+ miles** between the furthest observed nodes (end-to-end, over time)

These numbers come from real on-air data, not configuration or registration lists.

---

## 📈 Usage & Activity

Looking more closely at MeshBot and routing logs collected throughout January:

- The mesh shows **steady daily activity**, not bursty or one-off tests  
- Longer paths increasingly appear as *normal traffic*  
- Testing, weather requests, casual chat, and cross-city messages now blend together naturally  

That “boring reliability” is one of the best signs of a healthy mesh.

## 🗺️ Live Map, Real Data, and Regional Scale

- [https://omamesh.net/map/](https://omamesh.net/map/)
- [https://omamesh.net/list/](https://omamesh.net/list/)

The map shows **on-air observations only** — evidence, not limits.

The mesh footprint is now **regional in scale**, with nodes observed **over 70 miles apart end-to-end** over time.

## 🔗 Omaha ↔ Lincoln: A Deliberate Inter-City Link

The Lincoln MeshCore community has been building out their own city-wide mesh in parallel with Omaha.

Through a **well-placed node in Mead, Nebraska**, we now have **reliable and consistent messaging between Omaha and Lincoln**. This is a repeatable, exercised path — not a lucky one-off.

## 🤖 MeshBot Highlights

- First-time public channel greetings  
- Automatic node and path logging (feeds the live map)  
- Weather bulletins on `#omawx`  
- Structured diagnostics in `#test`  
- Polite, non-interrupting transmissions  
- Emergency channel monitoring with optional off-mesh alerts  

### 🌦️ `#omawx` quick guide

Examples:
- `wx`
- `wx Lincoln`
- `weather Mead NE`
- `wx tomorrow`

Replies are short, rate-limited, and designed for low airtime.

## 🎮 Games Over the Air

Turn-based games like **Connect Four** show how shared state and interaction work well on low-bandwidth meshes. Each move is just a small message, with retries and resync to handle real-world RF conditions.

## ⚙️ Radio Settings Reminder

- Region: **USA / Canada (Recommended)**  
- **SF9**  
- **CR 8** for repeaters  
- Save and reboot

## 🔭 What’s Next

- Better path visualization  
- More inter-city insight  
- Additional room-server and game experiments  

Say hi on the air, try `#test`, or just listen.
