  OmaMesh is built by the people using it — and we’d love to highlight more of your work on this site.

  If you have something to share, please reach out and we’ll give you simple instructions for contributing a post. We’re especially interested in:

  - Test cases and coverage experiments
  - Builds, antennas, and hardware setups
  - Human interest stories from the field
  - Lessons learned (what worked, what didn’t)
  - Creative uses of MeshCore or Meshtastic
  - Photos, maps, or data summaries

  You don’t need to be a writer. A few paragraphs, a few bullet points, or even raw notes are fine. We can help shape it into a post.

  If you’d like to contribute, send a note to **hello@omamesh.net** or message us on Discord. We’ll get you the short “how to post” instructions and a simple template.

  Thanks for helping make OmaMesh stronger — every node and every story matters.
